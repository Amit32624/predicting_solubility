# predicting_solubility

In this project, we will dive into the world of Cheminformatics which lies at the interface of Informatics and Chemistry. We will be reproducing a research article (by John S. Delaney$^1$) by applying Linear Regression to predict the solubility of molecules (i.e. solubility of drugs is an important physicochemical property in Drug discovery, design and development).

This idea for this project was inspired by the excellent blog post by Pat Walters$^2$ where he reproduced the linear regression model with similar degree of performance as that of Delaney. This example is also briefly described in the book Deep Learning for the Life Sciences: Applying Deep Learning to Genomics, Microscopy, Drug Discovery, and More.
